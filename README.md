# Blackjack
    A simple blackjack game. The graphics.py module was created by John Zelle for use with his book "Python Programming: An Introduction To Computer Science Second Edition".
The graphics.py module was created to be a simple introduction to computer graphics; it contains classes made from the Tkinter API.

# First Pygame
    This comes from a video tutorial on pygame found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTmJfWdZzbo. The original picture file for this tutorial were not listed on the page,
so I found some PNG files on Google Images that seemed to suit the program.
