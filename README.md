# Blackjack
    A simple blackjack game. The graphics.py module was created by John Zelle for use with his book "Python Programming: An Introduction To Computer Science Second Edition".
The graphics.py module was created to be a simple introduction to computer graphics; it contains classes made from the tkinter API. I have encountered a problem while
attempting to run this program on a mac, but not on my windows machine. When attempting to run on a mac, I get an error message from tkinter stating that it does not recognize
the information in the PNG files. While searching for an answer on Google and Stack Overflow, it seems as though there is an issue with files containing transparent
backgrounds. I may eventually re-write this game to run with pygame.

# First Pygame
    This comes from a video tutorial on pygame found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTmJfWdZzbo. The original picture file for this tutorial were not listed on the page,
so I found some PNG files on Google Images that seemed to suit the program.
